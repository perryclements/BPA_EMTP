Basically, install Visual Studio 2019 first and then the oneAPI Fortran compiler.

It takes one input data file to run the program. If no input file was given,  
the program will ask enter the input file name. Assume the input file name 
is test.dat, the program will put log information to test.dat.log and 
output results to test.dat.out in the same folder
